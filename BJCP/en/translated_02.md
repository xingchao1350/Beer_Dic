## Aroma   $~~~~~~~$ |**score**: 6  
Low levels of malt aroma, presenting as dough, wheat, and corn flavors. Low levels of hop aroma, with slight citrus and lemon notes. There is a noticeable lightstruck character, which is inappropriate for this style. Avoid light exposure during fermentation and storage, and not to use clear or green bottles for packaging.

## Appearance $~~~~~~~$ |**Score**: 1
The beer has a pale yellow color with low to medium clarity and slight haziness, which does not conform to the style. This style should exhibit a lighter color and be clear and clean. Increase cold conditioning time to achieve a clearer beer. The white foam is minimal, lacking thickness, and only forms a tight ring around the glass with low persistence.

## Flavor $~~~~~~~$ |**Score**: 11  
Low levels of maltiness, presenting as dough, wheat, grain, and corn sweetness. No hop aroma, very low hop bitterness, high fermentation character, with a dry finish. The aftertaste is dominated by maltiness, with a slight sourness in the lingering finish.

## Mouthfeel $~~~~~~~$ |**score**: 3  
Body low/light, medium carbonation, medium mouthfeel astringency. Low mouthfeel astringency, low acidity, mouthfeel dry but with an unpleasant lightstruck character, very low alcohol sensation, very low warmth.

## Overall Impression $~~~~~~~$ | **score**: 5  
The overall impression is somewhat deviated from the style due to lightstruck (skunky) aroma and slight oxidation.  
1. Avoid sunlight exposure, not to use transparent or green bottles, and to store in a dark place.  
2. Increase cold conditioning time to make the beer clearer.  
3. Reduce racking, avoid storage at room temperature, and prevent oxidation.  
4. With the above brewing improvements, this could become a fantastic beer. Keep it up!

The finish is semi-dry, with low malt flavor and even lower estery and phenolic character.

## Mouthfeel $~~~~~~~$ |**Score**: 3

Body is low, with moderate carbonation, medium-low mouthfeel, no irritating mouthfeel, smooth and dry, with a mouthfeel influenced by VDK, giving a slightly sweet and creamy sensation. Low alcohol sensation, no warmth, and very low astringent mouthfeel.

## Overall Impression $~~~~~~~$ | **Score**: 6  
The beer generally aligns with the style, but the presence of VDK and slight oxidation has hindered the expression of estery and phenolic aromas. Recommendations for brewing techniques:  
1. Ensure proper oxygenation of the wort when transferring to the fermenter, lower the fermentation temperature, avoid separating the yeast during the later stages of fermentation, and maintain a higher temperature for an extended period to facilitate VDK reduction.  
2. Avoid storing at room temperature; refrigerate and consume promptly to prevent oxidation.
